Seeing as hot dogs are my favorite food, I often like to indulge with some french fries on the side. However, also seeing as how I'm cheap, I buy the frozen ones and reseal them and put them back in the freezer when I'm done. Anyone else who has done this knows that every time you go to make fries you get some frozen mess that looks something like this:

Now what am I supposed to do with that? For decades I had struggled with this and ended up with soggy fries, until one day I thought of it. Here are the steps that will save your life one day (don't ask me how).<!--more-->

1. Take the frozen fry frenzy and put it in a colander or something similar

2. SLOWLY run room-temperature to warm water over the fries, swirling them around the colander as the water rinses the ice away.

3. After all the ice is broken away, dry the fries with a paper towel and place them on your cookie sheet. Then bake!
