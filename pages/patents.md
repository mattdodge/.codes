I have been fortunate over the years of my career to have worked on several patented technologies, many in the realm of distributed computing. The following are issued patents for work I have invented along with links, images, and simplified descriptions.

 - [System and method for fully configurable real time processing](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9454385B2)  
 US 9,454,385 B2  
 A software platform and framework for building real-time distributed systems. This technology allows users to apply simple configuration to complex distributed systems. This patent was the foundation for most of our work at [niolabs](https://niolabs.com).

 - [System and method for aggregating and acting on signals from one or more remote sources in real time using a configurable platform instance](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10154095B2)  
 US 10,154,095 B2  
 A method of configuring a distributed software installation to collect and process information from disparate data sources in real-time. This allows a user to connect to different types of data sources (APIs, databases, hardware, etc) from a distributed system.

 - [System and method for a development environment for building services for a platform instance](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9891893B2)  
 US 9,891,893 B2  
 A web-based development environment for defining and configuring complex distributed systems. This technology is a drag-and-drop, workflow-like tool that allows users to define the logic of large-scale distributed systems. This work was the foundation for the [niolabs System Designer](https://niolabs.com/product/system-designer).

 - [System And Method For Monitoring And Actuating Components In An Agricultural Environment Using A Configurable Software Platform](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180325050A1)  
 US 2018/0325050 A1  
 A configuration of a real-time control system in an agricultural setting. This patent defines a method to create an intelligent farm with automated controls using distributed computing.

 - [System and method for configuring a platform instance at runtime](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10073707B2)  
 US 10,073,707 B2  
 A method for configuring a distributed software platform to create real-time solutions. This patent describes a practical configuration of patent [US 9,454,385 B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9454385B2).

 - [System And Method For Providing a Communications Layer to Enable Full Participation in a Distributed Computing Environment That Uses Multiple Message Types](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190028414A1)  
  US 2019/0028414 A1  
  A software product that enables distributed nodes to communicate with one another with multiple communication protocols. This patent describes a technology that allows different protocols (e.g., HTTP, MQTT, WebSockets, etc.) to coexist in a distributed system. This patent provided the foundation for a produt that eventually became known as [Pubkeeper](https://niolabs.com/product/pubkeeper).

 - [System And Method For Reacquiring A Running Service After Restarting A Configurable Platform Instance](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180189080A1)  
 US 2018/0189080 A1  
 A technique that can be used in disaster or failover scenarios that allows a running daemon to pick up where it left off when it crashed. This method was used in numerous real-time Internet of Things installations to provide long-term resiliency to failures.

 - [System And Method For Monitoring Services And Blocks Within A Configurable Platform Instance](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180121321A1)  
 US 2018/0121321 A1  
 A technique that can be used to monitor long running processes in a distributed system. This method was used in numerous real-time Internet of Things installations to monitor system health over long periods of time.

 - [System And Method For Providing Persistence In A Configurable Platform Instance](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180121252A1)  
 US 2018/0121252 A1  
 A method of defining data storage and persistence in a distributed system. This patent defines a technique to configure both short-term and long-term data storage when the data is distributed across multiple nodes.

 - [System And Method For Multi-Tiered Real Time Processing Using Configurable Platform Instances](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180217870A1)  
 US 2018/0217870 A1  
 A method for configuring a distributed software platform to process disparate data at different nodes within the system. This patent describes a practical configuration of patent [US 9,454,385 B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9454385B2).

 - [System and method for providing configurable communications for services and platform instances on a per service basis](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2017085555A1)  
 WO 2017/085555 Al  
 A software platform that allows defining logic across distributed processes that run on different nodes within a system. This patent covers the software and the configuration of said software to create highly performant distributed systems.

 - [System and method for a development environment for building services for a platform instance](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2016156974A1)  
 WO 2016/156974 Al  
 A web-based development environment for defining and configuring complex distributed systems. This technology is a drag-and-drop, workflow-like tool that allows users to define the logic of large-scale distributed systems. This is the international version of [US 9,891,893 B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9891893B2).

 - [System and method for aggregating and acting on signals from one or more remote sources in real time using a configurable platform instance](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2016166596A1)  
 WO 2016/166596 Al  
 A method of configuring a distributed software installation to collect and process information from disparate data sources in real-time. This allows a user to connect to different types of data sources (APIs, databases, hardware, etc) from a distributed system. This is the internationl version of [US 10,154,095 B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10154095B2).
