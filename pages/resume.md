## Ask Me About
---

The following are some unique experiences and skills that I have been able to work on throughout my career. These are intended to offer an insight into what I can bring to a team or be a good conversation starter during an interview.

**Growing a software development team from 0 to 20**  
At niolabs I was the first developer (founder) and ultimately grew the team to have over 20 engineers. I learned and experienced first hand the different milestones that occur along the way and understand the processes that must be in place when growing a team.

**Contributing to and utilizing the open-source community in a secure way**  
As a frequent consumer of open-source software, both as an individual and as a technical director, I feel that it is important to give back to the community as well. By instituting goals around community and open-source development at niolabs, we, as a team of 20 engineers, were able to contribute over 1,000 hours to the open-source community in 2018. I also added open-source dependency and audit checks into our deployment pipelines so that when libraries were installed or updated a security verification took place.

**Creating reliable and secure deployment pipelines**  
In a fast-moving company you often have many small teams working on many different parts of the product. As a result, it is important to let these teams have control over the deployment and maintenance of their product lines without impacting others. Using tools like Jenkins and Terraform I created numerous secure deployment pipelines at niolabs that could be triggered and monitored by product owners.

**Enabling team members to have work/life balance**  
There's no doubt that happy employees make better employees. However, in a small team especially, the work day can't stop at 6 PM every day. Outages and support requests come in on nights and weekends too. I believe we did a great job at niolabs of having satisfied developers who were able to pursue hobbies and interests outside of work.

**Creating a practical and effective interview process for developers**  
Determining whether a developer will be a valuable asset to the team is extremely difficult to ascertain. While whiteboard coding and algorithmic logic puzzles seem to be the norm, I don't believe those are adequate assessments of a prospective candidate. At niolabs I implemented a unique and effective interview process that involved some take-home work, live collaborative coding, and an objective assessment matrix.

**Marketing and pricing enterprise software in a nascent market**  
The Internet of Things market is essentially brand new in the enterprise. Therefore there are few reference points for both product companies and clients on what pricing should look like. For several years at niolabs we researched and tested out different marketing and pricing strategies for how to deliver our products effectively.

**Creating a confident development and deployment culture**  
There is a growing belief in the tech community that one should not deploy on Fridays, for fear that something may break and that work may have to occur over the weekend. I don't agree with this approach and believe that if you think that way it means you don't have confidence in your deployments or your ability to roll back. With proper quality control, production awareness, and deployment strategies I think deployments should be able to occur as often or whenever needed.
